# PointCloud_Distortion
This repository contains a Python implementation for simulating various disturbances on point cloud data, typically generated by LiDAR or RADAR sensors. These disturbances are intended to model real-world scenarios where sensor data might be affected by various environmental or technical factors, helping to evaluate the robustness of algorithms that process point cloud data.
Features

* Add Points: Randomly adds new points to the existing point cloud within a specified Region of Interest (ROI).
* Lose Points: Randomly removes a portion of the points from the point cloud, simulating data loss
* *Shifting: Applies random shifts to the points in the point cloud, simulating calibration errors or mechanical vibrations
* Cluster: Adds groups of points to the point cloud, simulating local disturbances like dust, smoke, or interference
* Information Noise: Adds noise to the additional information (e.g., intensity, magnitude) associated with each point, simulating measurement errors.
